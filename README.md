# Palette
A tool to design and generate color palettes for beautiful interfaces

Every piece of software deserves a great color palette. Creating a great color palette, though, is quite the challenge.

It's hard enough to find a palette of base colors (e.g. red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, gray) that harmonize with each other. It's harder to find a palette of base colors that give your piece of software a distinct identity. But that's only the start: what about shades? Creating a set of shades for each color, from light to dark, is extremely tedious. Making a palette of colors that harmonize at each shade, while also satisfying accessibility thresholds, is a feat.

Palette aims to dramatically simplify the color palette design process â€” with your help, it can simplify the process even further.
